# Checkout Counter Receipt System

The Checkout Counter Receipt System is a Java-based application designed to simulate the checkout process in a retail setting. It calculates the total price of an item based on its weight and unit price, adds tax, and then computes the change from the cash tendered. This project is ideal for learning basic Java concepts, including object-oriented programming, user input handling, and simple arithmetic operations.

## Features

- **User Input for Item Details**: Prompt users to enter the weight and cash tendered for the item.
- **Flexible Tax Rates**: Easily adjustable tax rate within the code.
- **Detailed Receipt Output**: Provides a detailed receipt, including weight, unit price, net price, tax, total price, cash tendered, and change.
- **Formatted Output**: The receipt is well-formatted for easy reading.

## How to Run

To run the Checkout Counter Receipt System, you will need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. This project was developed and tested with JDK version 11, but it should be compatible with other versions that support Java SE features used in the code.

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
